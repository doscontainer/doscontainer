# Welcome to DOSContainer

DOSContainer aims to provide a command line generator for 100% vintage-compatible
floppy and hard disk images for IBM-PC and compatibles. This aims to support my
retro computing hobby and the collection building that goes with it.

> :warning: **I'm importing and cleaning up an older version of my codebase. Broken builds abound!**

## What's the point?

The DOS computing environment consisted of huge numbers of hardware configurations
with all kinds of drivers and compatibility quirks. That fact, coupled with the fact
that there were thousands of games and applications, accounts for literally a bazillion
of possible permutations between all of those moving parts.

In order to help collection builders, DOSContainer aims to facilitate the quick creation
of pristine disk image files that make up a collection. You tweak the manifest file that
serves as input, then DOSContainer pops out a cleanly generated new disk image that is
configured precisely to your specifications.

You want all of your hundreds of games to boot with EGA configured and Roland MT-32 sound?
DOSContainer makes it easy to do that. It also makes it easy to change your mind and
upgrade to VGA later on, or swap in a newer version of your mouse driver across thousands
of disk images in a single go.
