# DOSContainer has moved

With the activation of the DOSContainer website under its own domain, the code
hosting also moved there.

## Website: [dosontainer.click](https://doscontainer.click)

## Code: [code.doscontainer.click](https://code.doscontainer.click)

The repo is just as public as always and you're welcome to contribute. You can
log into the forge through GitHub even, or sign up for a dedicated DOSContainer 
account.

all for now though.
